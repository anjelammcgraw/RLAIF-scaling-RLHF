# 🤖 RLAIF: Leveraging Constitutional AI to Scale RLHF

In this repo, we'll be creating a harmlessness dataset using our base model, constitutional AI, and self-refinement!. The base model we'll be using is the Zephyr-7b-alpha model. This project was done during Week 4 of AI Makerspace's LLM Engineering Cohort 2 (LLME2).
